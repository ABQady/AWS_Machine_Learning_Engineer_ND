# AWS Machine Learning Engineer NanoDegree by Udacity

The goal of the AWS Machine Learning Engineer (MLE) Nanodegree program is to equip software developers/data scientists with the data science and machine learning skills required to build and deploy machine learning models in production using Amazon SageMaker. This program focus on the latest best practices and capabilities that are enabled by Amazon SageMaker, including new model design/deployment features and case studies in which they can be applied to.

This repo contains projects for AWS ML Engineer ND.

## Project 1: Bike Sharing Demand Predection by Auto Gluon.

Bike-sharing demand is highly relevant to related problems companies encounter, such as Uber, Lyft, and DoorDash. Predicting demand not only helps businesses prepare for spikes in their services but also improves customer experience by limiting delays.

In this project, the AutoGluon library is used to train several models for the Bike Sharing Demand competition in Kaggle. Tabular Prediction is used to fit data from CSV files provided by the competition. This project demonstrates the ability of using AutoGluon to train several iterations of models and records the optimization of the problem.

## Project 2: Image Classification Project - Scones Unlimited

Image Classifiers are used in the field of computer vision to identify the content of an image and it is used across a broad variety of industries, from advanced technologies like autonomous vehicles and augmented reality, to eCommerce platforms, and even in diagnostic medicine.

In this project, an image classification model is built to automatically detect which kind of vehicle delivery drivers have, in order to route them to the correct loading bay and orders. Assigning delivery professionals who have a bicycle to nearby orders and giving motorcyclists orders that are farther can help Scones Unlimited optimize their operations.

## Project 3: Image Classification using AWS SageMaker - Dog Breed

In this project, AWS Sagemaker is used to finetune a pretrained model that can perform image classification. Sagemaker profiling, debugger, hyperparameter tuning and other good ML engineering practices are used in this project. The dog breed classication dataset is used to classify between different breeds of dogs in images.

## Project 4: Operationalizing ML on SageMaker

This project starts with a completed ML project. The completed project contains code that trains and deploys an image classification model on AWS Sagemaker. The goal in this project is to use several important tools and features of AWS to adjust, improve, configure, and prepare the initial model for production-grade deployment. Taking raw ML code and preparing it for production deployment is a common task for ML engineers, and it's very important.

## Project 5: Capstone - Inventory Monitoring at Distribution Centers

Distribution centers often use robots to move objects as a part of their operations. Objects are carried in bins which can contain multiple objects. In this project, a model is built to count the number of objects in each bin. A system like this can be used to track inventory and make sure that delivery consignments have the correct number of items.

AWS SageMaker and good machine learning engineering practices are used to fetch data from a database, preprocess it, and then train a machine learning model. This project serves as a demonstration of end-to-end machine learning engineering skills that i have learned as a part of this nanodegree.
